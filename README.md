Cave
====

A small roguelike cave/island generator i build 2 years ago. Mostly here to play with GitHub for the first time. 

Written in C#

It is a cellular automaton.

UI-Elements:
Textbox: percentage of filled fields in grid
Checkbox (Ramen?): Do you want a border (generates caves) or no border (generates islands)
button1: fills grid
button2: starts one cycle of the cellular automaton
